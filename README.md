# MetaBridge: AI-Powered Cross-Platform Asset Translator  

DeepSeek Tool - Metaverse & Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the integration of the **DeepSeek tool**, **Metaverse technologies**, and **Machine Learning (ML)** to create innovative solutions.

## Overview  
MetaBridge is an AI-powered tool for seamless 3D asset conversion and processing across multiple formats. It automates tasks such as asset metadata extraction, format conversion, API integration, and batch processing.  

## Features
- Advanced analytics using the DeepSeek tool.
- Incorporates Metaverse technologies for immersive experiences.
- Machine learning models to enhance predictions and insights.

# Running MetaBridge Project  

## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8 or later  
- Git installed  
- Pip (Python package manager) installed  

## Step 1: Clone the Repository  

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/MetaBridge.git
cd MetaBridge

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 3: Process a 3D Asset
Run the asset processing script to extract metadata:

python scripts/process_asset.py

## Step 4: Convert OBJ to STL
Convert a 3D model from OBJ to STL format:

python scripts/convert_asset.py

## Step 5: Run Batch Processing
Process multiple assets at once:

python scripts/batch_process.py

## Step 6: Run API Client
Upload assets via API:

python scripts/api_client.py

## Step 7: Run Tests
To validate the scripts, run tests:

pytest tests/

Additional Information
All processed assets are stored in the data/ folder.
Log files and temporary files are cleaned using scripts/cleanup_assets.py.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, try reinstalling dependencies:

pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
